# Aquality
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, shellfish and plants has become an important industry in Indonesia, with great potential in supporting food security and the national economy. Vast natural resources enable the development of aquaculture, where the biofloc method is emerging as a promising sustainable approach. This method utilises the accumulation of microorganisms and organic matter in a controlled water environment, offering advantages over traditional methods.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) open up new opportunities to revolutionise the sector, especially in checking the quality of aquaculture water, which has been done manually.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Aquality comes as a website that distributes Internet of Things (IoT) devices to monitor water quality. This website is targeted at fish farmers or cultivators.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was made to fulfil the final assignment of the Digital Financial Platform course. This project was made using WordPress, utilising the WooCommerce plugin to build the e-commerce platform in WordPress and the Xendit plugin as the payment gateway.
